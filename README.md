## Build

Run front end build script (this is used by Netlify to deploy the site):
```
npm run build --workspace=web
```

Run the Sanity build process:
```
npm run build --workspace=studio
```

## Deploy

- Commits on the master branch automatically deploy the site on Netlify

- Publishing content in Sanity also causes the site to deploy via a Netlify Webhook.

- Update the sanity studio in produciton

  ```
  cd studio && sanity deploy
  ```
  This requires [@sanity/cli](https://www.sanity.io/docs/getting-started-with-sanity-cli) to be installed locally.
